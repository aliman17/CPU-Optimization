# CPU-Optimization

### Introduction

This repository corresponds to the course __How to Write Fast Numerical Code__, 
held by Markus Pueschel (https://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/markusp/). The repository contains
template, filled with my solutions for CPU optimization. For more details, I really recomend 
to check the link. 

For any other question, please feel free to contact me.
